# AlwaysWatching

This project is a home security sortware aimed at keeping track of people who enter the area of interest (where the camera is).
Currently records video and takes a picture when a new person enters the frame.

Issues:
- Laggy, need to implement different threads for tasks
- Doesn't have a database to know if person is a stranger

Future Features
- Add a database where you can add trusted people
- Needs to be able to send a notification, to phone/app or email?
